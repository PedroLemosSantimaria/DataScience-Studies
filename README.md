# DataScience-Studies  

This repository contains my studies and practical implementations of data analysis using **Python** and **R**, focusing on statistical methods and data manipulation.  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  

The repository includes:  
- **Python** and **R** implementations for basic statistical functions.  
- **Data manipulation** using `dplyr` (R) and `pandas` (Python).  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, including mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation.  
- **Comparative analysis** between two datasets to identify trends and patterns.  

## ðŸ“‚ Contents  

### ðŸ”¹ R Code  
- Function to compute the **mean and median** of students' grades.  
- Sorting data by age and calculating statistical relationships.  
- Correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between grades and age.  

### ðŸ”¹ Python Code (`.ipynb`)  
- Jupyter Notebook with equivalent **data analysis** in Python.  
- Uses `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for analysis and visualization.  
- Comparison between younger and older studentsâ€™ grades.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  

- **R**: `dplyr`, `data.frame`, `cor() function`  
- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
